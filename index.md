## Welcome to HRIPIE ! 

We are currently a non-profit research institute based in Canton Greater Bay Area, mostly in **Guangzhou**. 

We spend half of our time to advance human knowledge without concern for immediate application, and the other half to apply mathematics to **pharmacometrics** and **industrial engineering**, which directly leads to patents. In some cases, our patents will turn into products, verified by our premier collaborator, Honz Pharma Group. 

### Courses

[MA102 Mathematics II](https://github.com/NanFangHong/HRIPIE-MA102)
